# SchoolOfWaterMagic
A copy of my AI generated School of Water Magic Educational Flyer


This was used to teach school children about coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation at the 2023 Houston Waterworks Festival. 

The flyer was accompanied by a practical demonstration of the proccess by adding Ferric Chloride Salt to a bottle of clay-ey water. Like adding a magic potion, we walk through the stages of coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation that is occuring behding every drop of tap water without hardly anyone knowing.
